## Business Problem

Ride-hailing companies generate thousands of trip records every month. Raw exports contain duplicates, inconsistent text formats, missing values, invalid distances, and negative rates.

**Goal:** Build a repeatable data engineering pipeline that transforms raw trip data into trusted analytics-ready tables and dashboards.

## Tech Stack

- Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines
- SQL
- Unity Catalog
- Delta Lake

## Dataset

Synthetic Ride-Hailing Dataset

- 1,214 rows
- 20 columns
- Cab trip records
- Data quality issues intentionally introduced


## Layer Details

### Bronze Layer

- Loads raw trip CSV
- Preserves source data
- Adds file metadata
- Adds ingestion timestamp

### Silver Layer

- Removes duplicate trip_id records
- Cleans city and vehicle names
- Replaces missing city values
- Recalculates missing fares
- Separates rejected records

### Gold Layer

#### gold_monthly_trips

- Trips
- Revenue
- Driver payout
- Platform earning

#### gold_city_summary

- Trips by city
- Revenue by city
- Average fare

#### gold_vehicle_summary

- Trips by vehicle
- Revenue by vehicle
- Average rating

#### gold_payment_summary

- Revenue by payment method
- Pending payments

#### gold_data_quality

- Duplicate count
- Missing values
- Invalid distance
- Invalid rate
- Reconciliation

## Data Quality Rules

| Rule | Treatment |
|--------|--------|
| Duplicate trip_id | Removed |
| Missing city | Unknown |
| Missing payment method | Unknown |
| Missing fare | Recalculated |
| Invalid distance | Rejected |
| Invalid rate | Rejected |

## Reconciliation

bronze_rows = clean_rows + rejected_rows + duplicate_rows

Ensures no records are lost during processing.

## Dashboard

### Page 1 – Overview

- Total Trips
- Total Revenue
- Platform Earnings
- Monthly Revenue Trend

### Page 2 – Vehicle & Payments

- Trips by Vehicle
- Revenue by Vehicle

- Rejected Rows
- Duplicate Rows
- Reconciliation Status

## How to Run

1. Upload dataset to Unity Catalog Volume.
2. Create Databricks pipeline.
3. Configure catalog and schema.
4. Run Bronze layer.
5. Run Silver layer.
6. Run Gold layer.
7. Validate reconciliation.
8. Build dashboard.
